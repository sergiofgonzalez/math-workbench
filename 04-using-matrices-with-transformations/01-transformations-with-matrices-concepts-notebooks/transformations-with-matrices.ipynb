    "We saw in the previous chapter that any linear transformation in 3D can be specified by knowing how it affects the three standard basis vectors $ e1 $, $ e2 $, and $ e3 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that exactly 9 numbers uniquely identify the effects of linear transformation. When arranged appropriately, the numbers that tell us how to compute a linear transformation are called a *matrix*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these matrices should be considered *computational tools* or a *notation* that will help use calculate these transformations more efficiently, but ultimately, we will be doing the same transformations we performed on the previous chapters: rotations, scaling, reflection, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying idea would be to arrange in the matrix the information of that tells us how the linear transformation affects the standar basis vectors."
