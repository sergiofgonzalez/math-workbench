# 04 &mdash; Using matrices with transformations
> TBD

## Concepts and standalone projects
TBD

### [Transformations with matrices](./01-transformations-with-matrices)
A notebook with all the concepts and examples of the chapter.

### [Draw animated transformation](./02-draw-animated-transformation)
A standalone project in which the `draw_model(...)` function is modified to include an additional named parameter that allows passing a transformation matrix. The transformation is used to transform the 3D shape (faces) before displaying every frame, to animate it.


### Exercises and *above and beyond* standalone projects
TBD

### [Exercises: Setting up shop](./e00-setting-up-shop-exercises)
A notebook with the exercises of the *Setting up shop* section.

### [Above and Beyond: Teapot animation](./e01-teapot-animated-perspective)
Standalone project with the Utah teapot animation. The project does not listen to any key or mouse events.

### [Exercises: Transformation concepts](./e02-transformation-exercises-notebook)
A notebook with the exercises of the concepts section.

### [Above and Beyond: Custom Implementations](./e03-my-implementation)
The collection of libraries and support functions for vector arithmetic, transformation and animations that have either been refactored, annotated or enhanced.
