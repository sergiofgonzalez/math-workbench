# 04 &mdash; Using matrices with transformations
> TBD

## Concepts and standalone projects

### [Transformations with matrices](./01-transformations-with-matrices)
A notebook with all the concepts and examples of the chapter.

### [Draw animated transformation](./02-draw-animated-transformation)
A standalone project in which the `draw_model(...)` function is modified to include an additional named parameter that allows passing a transformation matrix. The transformation is used to transform the 3D shape (faces) before displaying every frame, to animate it.


## Exercises and *above and beyond* standalone projects

### [Exercises: My Libs](./e00-my-libs)
A project that includes custom implementation of the libraries. The implementation is well curated and include unit tests and some of the functions feature argument validations.

### [Exercises: Transformation  with matrices concepts](./e01-transformation-with-matrices-exercises-notebook)
A notebook with the exercises of the concepts section.
