# My libs
> the collection of libraries and support functions used throughout the book but written by me


## Description

+ `my_vectors.py` &mdash; library of vector related functions to add vectors, cross product, etc., along with some support functions that transform degrees to radians, and vice versa, etc.
+ `my_transformations.py` &mdash; library of transformations such as `scale_by(...)`, `translate_by(...)`, `rotate_*_by(...)`. Also, `linear_combination(...)` is defined here.
+ `my_matrices.py` &mdash; librate of matrix related functions to multiply matrices and vectors, multiply matrices, etc.


Remember that you run the project you must do:
```bash

$ pwd
[...]/03-transformations/e03-my-implementation

# it must be run within the project directory so that teapot.off is found
$ python3 testing_my_impls.py
```
