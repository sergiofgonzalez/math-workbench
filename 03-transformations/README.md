# 03 &mdash; Transformations
> transforming vectors and 3D shapes using mathematical functions

## Concepts and standalone projects

### [Setting up shop](./00-setting-up-shop-notebook)
A notebook with details on how to install additional libraries required for this chapter (*PyGame* and *PyOpenGL*). Also, the first steps into these libraries and a few examples are given.

### [Concepts on Transformations](./01-transformation-concepts-notebook)
A notebook with all the concepts and examples of the chapter.

### [Octahedron 3D](./02-octahedron-3d)
A shakedown test on *PyOpenGL* and *PyGame* concepts applied to the octahedron shape.

### [Octahedron 3D](./02-octahedron-3d)
A shakedown test on *PyOpenGL* and *PyGame* concepts applied to the octahedron shape.
The main program listens to simple key and mouse events such as:
+ `a` &mdash; start animation of the 3D shape rotating it about the three axes
+ `s` &mdash; stop animation
+ `left mouse button` &mdash; rotate the 3D shape about the z axis 30°
+ `right mouse button` &mdash; rotate the 3D shape about the y and z axis 30°

## Exercises and *above and beyond* standalone projects

### [Exercises: Setting up shop](./e00-setting-up-shop-exercises)
A notebook with the exercises of the *Setting up shop* section.

### [Above and Beyond: Teapot animation](./e01-teapot-animated-perspective)
Standalone project with the Utah teapot animation. The project does not listen to any key or mouse events.

### [Exercises: Transformation concepts](./e02-transformation-exercises-notebook)
A notebook with the exercises of the concepts section.

### [Above and Beyond: Custom Implementations](./e03-my-implementation)
The collection of libraries and support functions for vector arithmetic, transformation and animations that have either been refactored, annotated or enhanced.
