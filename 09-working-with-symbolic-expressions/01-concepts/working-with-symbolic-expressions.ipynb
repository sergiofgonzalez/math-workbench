    "In the previous chapters we've used Python to approximate solutions for two of the most important concepts in calculus: derivatives and integrals. \n",

    "We learned to calculate derivatives by taking slopes of smaller and smaller secant lines, and to calculate integrals by estimating the area under a graph with thinner and thiner rectangles.\n",

    "By using that *programmatic* approach, we've been able to work do very interesting applications without following the *formal* approach first.\n",

    "That *formal* (non-programmatic) approach dictates how to calculate the exact formula for a derivative and integral.\n",
