    "Linear algebra generalizes all the concepts we've handled thus far in 2D, 3D and 4D to any number of dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will also create *programmatic generalizations* and define *vector spaces*. Vector spaces are collections of objects that we can treat like vectors. These can be arrows in the plane, tuples of numbers, or objects that we can treat like vectors such as images (which we can combine to create new images).\n",
    "\n",
    "The key operations in a vector space will be vector addition, and scalar multiplication, as with these you will be able to do linear combinations.\n",
