# 02 &mdash; Vectors in the 3D Space
> vectors and vector arithmetics in the 3D space

All the information has been included inline in the [concepts](01-the-3d-space-notebook/vectors-in-3d.ipynb) section.

You can find the exercises and additional material [here](e01-vectors-3d-exercises/vectors-3d-exercises.ipynb).

The folder [02-vector-3d-arithmetic](02-the-3d-space/02-vector-3d-arithmetic) contains the `vector_arithmetic.py` library with all vector arithmetic functions for 2D, 3D and higher dimensions discussed in the concepts and exercises sections.
